# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial. Every beginning Python programmer should understand these basic topics:

-  [Queues](queues.md)
-  [Sets](sets.md)
-  [Trees](trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
